## Introduction
This repository contains a feature-rich e-commerce application built using React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Docker, with deployment on AWS EC2. It was developed as an individual project to gain hands-on experience in full-stack development, secure authentication, and containerized deployment.

Key Features:
- Frontend:

  -Built with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
  -Includes key components like a product list, product details, shopping cart, and wishlist.
  -Integration with RESTful APIs for seamless interaction with the backend.

  -MongoDB Atlas for persistent data storage of products, cart, wishlist, and user information.

-Authentication:

  -Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user login and session management.
  -Includes user registration, profile management, and access control for cart and wishlist functionalities.

- Deployment:

  -Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using PM2 for process management.
  -Dockerized application with container orchestration via Docker Compose, including Caddy as a reverse proxy for HTTPS support.
- Additional Features:
  -User-specific cart and wishlist functionality.
  -Authentication-based access control for secure operations.
  -Persistent state management with localStorage for cart and wishlist.
This project demonstrates skills in full-stack development, integrating multiple technologies, and deploying robust web applications. Perfect for showcasing individual expertise in real-world application development.

```
#### Set Up the Docker Repository:
```
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
#### Install Docker:
```
sudo apt update
